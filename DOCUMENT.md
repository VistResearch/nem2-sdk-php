## Core/sodium_compact/
I implement the elliptic curve with sodium_compact and Keccak with kornrunner/keccak. Keccak can be directly use so it is in the composer file, but the elliptic curve part need to adapt with both SHA3_256 and Keccak_256, so I change part of its source code in order to change its hash algorithm. So what Core/Crypto does in JS/TS SDK is just like what Core/sodium_compat does in php SDK.


## Core/Buffer.php
Another difference is about the buffer file. I use this buffer object to serialize the transaction. There are method about add objects like deadline, account to this buffer object and method about serialize to a binary array. Every transaction type correspond to one method in this object.
	
## Core/SerializeBase.php
Some basic method used in Buffer.php.

## Core/Identifier.php
Implement the Id related part, both namespace and Mosaic are included in this file.


## Models/
Basically all files in Model/ are same as those in TS/JS SDK. And I copied the discription in TS/JS SDK for user to read.


## Infrastructure/
Files here are generated by swagger.
